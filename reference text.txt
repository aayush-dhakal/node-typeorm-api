For database tables:
1. One client can have many transactions or many transactions can belong to one client.
2. Many bankers can many many clients and many clients can have many bankers.

Realtion facts:
1. For one to one relation:
- for both raw sql and typeorm:- we can just make a foreign key in the table which have many realtions associated with other table and put its foreign key value as primary_key of other table.
2. For many to many relations:
- for raw sql:- we define a seperate new table which has the primary_key of both tables 
- for typeorm:- we can simply use ManyToMany decorator and not define a seperate table for it and typeorm will automatically create a new table for us with name as tableA_tableB
